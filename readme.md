# Project README

This project is a speech processing application that utilizes OpenAI's APIs for transcription and text-to-speech (TTS) conversion. It includes functionality for transcribing audio, generating responses based on transcriptions, and converting text to speech using OpenAI's TTS API.

## Usage

To transcribe audio and generate responses, the project uses OpenAI's transcription and completion models. The `generate_response` function is used to generate responses based on transcriptions, and the `generate_tts_response_openai` function is used to convert text to speech using OpenAI's TTS API.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the OpenAI API key in the configuration file.
2. Use the provided functions to transcribe audio, generate responses, and convert text to speech.
